              <h2>More inclusive camera</h2>
              <p>Google says it is creating a smartphone camera that more accurately depicts skin tone.
"For people of colour, photography has not always seen us as we want to be seen, even in some of our own Google products" said Google's Sameer Samat.
Google says it's making changes to auto white balance adjustments "to bring out natural brown tones".
The company says it is also working on new algorithms to better distinguish the subject from a background.
The camera will be ready on the new Google Pixel which will be out later this year.</p>

              <h2>AI-curated albums</h2>
              <p>Google Photos will use AI to curate collections to share with the user, similar to Memories on Apple and Facebook.A big complaint from users of Apple's or Facebook's feature is when people are reminded of breakups or tough times in their lives.Google says they have taken this into consideration and will allow users to control which photos they do or don't see by letting them remove specific images, people or time periods.</p>
